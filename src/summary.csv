Initially, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning covered parts of the Gascoyne and Central West, but this was extended south to cover the Perth Metro and Mandurah after 3:30pm.%D %D While no observations of severe phenomena were observed for this event, radar indications strongly suggested severe thunderstorms occurred in the warning zone at times during the day. In the northern half of the warning area, storms around the Three Peaks township displayed VIL peaks of greater than 60kg/m2 (suggesting hail >= 2cm). Further south, a supercell developed near Yanchep with VIL peaks of greater than 110kg/m2. The widespread activity in the south generated a cold pool, which suppressed further storm activity; the STW for the Perth Metro was cancelled at 6:30pm.

The strongest evidence to support tornadic activity is a gust of 213km/h at Kurnell AWS at 10.33am, with SES reports confirming the removal of rooves from houses and uprooting of mature trees in the area. A range of images from online social and news media also show damage to a number of properties in Kurnell, an over turned truck, and the partial removal of the roof of the desalination plant. The strength of the observed wind gust and onsite visual evidence of the damage place this tornado in the F2 category. Later reports emerged (~11.40am) from head office media stating a number of callers from Bondi Beach sighting a tornado. Based on radar data at this time and no specific damage reports it was most likely offshore. LGA: Sutherland Shire.",

This cell tracked slowly east towards Singleton by 4.30pm, then northeast towards Nabiac by 6.30pm. Doppler radar showed a clearly defined low level velocity couplet lasting for over an hour with this storm, weakening once the cell tracked past Singleton. The SES reported significant damage at Doyles Creek and Singleton, including some roofs partially or fully lifted off, trees down on roads, and some trees crushing cars. Secondhand reports (friend of a storm spotter) were received of tornado damage at the Darley and Coolmore Horse Studs and mines including trees ripped out of the ground. The location of this report is consistent with the position of the low level velocity couplet. One photo on social media shows a mature tree with large branches broken off and a wire fence bent over at Jerrys Plains, with all debris aligned in the same direction.
