## Notes to run Jupyter Notebook

The best way to run Jupyter Notebook is to download and install
Anaconda.  This can be downloaded from here:

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

It is highly recommended that you download the Python 3 version
(currently V3.6).

If you are on a windows computer, you should be able to run Jupyter
Notebook from the start menu.  For Mac users, it may be easiest to open
a terminal and type `Jupyter Notebook`.
